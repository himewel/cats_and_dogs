# Cats and dogs classification

This repo presents a simple image classificator of images with cats and dogs. To do it, Tensorflow and Keras are used to build and train a convolutional network writed in Python with a Jupyter Notebook. Besides that, the notebook haves a snippet to download files from Google Drive (where the dataset is stored). The final version of the CNN has 4 convolutional layers with batch normalization and max pool layers between then to extract the features from the image. The 2 full connected layers in the end of the CNN has 1024 neurons to make the image classification. A sample of prediction is presented at the end of the notebook.
